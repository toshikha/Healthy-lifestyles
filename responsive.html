          Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying
          unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
          Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
          health, and boosting your mood. Healthy eating doesn’t have to be
          overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting
          nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that
          for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you.

          find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some
          specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial
          effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most
          important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace
          processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is
          as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge
          difference to the way you think, look, and feel.

          By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and
          learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet
          that is as good for your mind as it is for your body. The fundamentals
          of healthy eating While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we
          all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins,
          and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to
          eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select
          the healthiest options from each category.

          Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while
          also supporting mood and cognitive function. Too much protein can be
          harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research
          suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as
          we age. That doesn't mean you have to eat more animal products—a
          variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your
          body gets all the essential protein it needs. Learn more » Fat. Not
          all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase
          your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart.
          In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and
          emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help
          improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your
          waistline.

          Fiber. Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables,
          nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for
          heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your skin and
          even help you to lose weight. Learn more » Calcium. As well as leading
          to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also
          contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever
          your age or gender, it's vital to include calcium-rich foods in your
          diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and
          vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job. Learn more »
          Carbohydrates are one of your body's main sources of energy. But most
          should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains,
          fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs. Cutting back on white
          bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood
          sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat,
          especially around your waistline.

          Making the switch to a healthy diet Switching to a healthy diet
          doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don't have to be
          perfect, you don't have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and
          you don't have to change everything all at once—that usually only
          leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan. A better
          approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals
          modest can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling
          deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a
          healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a
          salad to your diet once a day. As your small changes become habit, you
          can continue to add more healthy choices.

          Think smaller portions. Serving sizes have ballooned recently. When
          dining out, choose a starter instead of an entree, split a dish with a
          friend, and don't order supersized anything. At home, visual cues can
          help with portion sizes. Your serving of meat, fish, or chicken should
          be the size of a deck of cards and half a cup of mashed potato, rice,
          or pasta is about the size of a traditional light bulb. By serving
          your meals on smaller plates or in bowls, you can trick your brain
          into thinking it's a larger portion. If you don't feel satisfied at
          the end of a meal, add more leafy greens or round off the meal with
          fruit. Take your time. It's important to slow down and think about
          food as nourishment rather than just something to gulp down in between
          meetings or on the way to pick up the kids. It actually takes a few
          minutes for your brain to tell your body that it has had enough food,
          so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full. Eat with others
          whenever possible. Eating alone, especially in front of the TV or
          computer, often leads to mindless overeating.

          Limit snack foods in the home. Be careful about the foods you keep at
          hand. It's more challenging to eat in moderation if you have unhealthy
          snacks and treats at the ready. Instead, surround yourself with
          healthy choices and when you're ready to reward yourself with a
          special treat, go out and get it then. Control emotional eating. We
          don't always eat just to satisfy hunger. Many of us also turn to food
          to relieve stress or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness,
          loneliness, or boredom. But by learning healthier ways to manage
          stress and emotions, you can regain control over the food you eat and
          your feelings. It's not just what you eat, but when you eat Eat
          breakfast, and eat smaller meals throughout the day. A healthy
          breakfast can jumpstart your metabolism, while eating small, healthy
          meals keeps your energy up all day.
